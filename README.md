## Overview

This is a simple Chrome Extension that adds a new filter selection to the
Audible website's library view, which shows your purchased books.

The filter selection can be set to either Hide Finished Books (default)
or Show Finished Books. Books that have been marked as finished are hidden
when the Hide Finished Books selection is chosen.

Note that you can mark books as finished in the Audible iPhone application.
At present time there doesn't seem to be a way to mark them as finished
on the website.

## Installation

To install this open source version, please follow Google Chrome's
developer tutorial on how to use Load Unpacked to add an extension:
